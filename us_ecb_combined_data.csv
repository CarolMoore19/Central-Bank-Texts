committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions the committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases. beginning in january the committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of 35 billion per month rather than 40 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer-term treasury securities at a pace of 40 billion per month rather than 45 billion per month. the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction. the committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate. the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. the committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy the committee will also consider other information including additional measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments. the committee now anticipates based on its assessment of these factors that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2

economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the committee's dual mandate. the committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. if incoming information broadly supports the committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective the committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. the committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy the committee will also consider other information including additional measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments. the committee continues to anticipate based on its assessment of these factors that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent especially if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2

(2) in tltro iii, considerably more favourable terms will be applied during the period from june 2020 to june 2021 to all tltro iii operations outstanding during that same time. these operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. throughout this period, the interest rate on these tltro iii operations will be 25 basis points below the average rate applied in the eurosystem's main refinancing operations. for counterparties that maintain their levels of credit provision, the rate applied in these operations will be lower, and, over the period ending in june 2021, can be as low as 25 basis points below the average interest rate on the deposit facility. moreover, the maximum total amount that counterparties will henceforth be entitled to borrow in tltro iii operations is raised to 50% of their stock of eligible loans as at 28 february 2019. in this context, the governing council will mandate the eurosystem committees to investigate collateral easing measures to ensure that counterparties continue to be able to make full use of the funding support. (3) a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of 120 billion will be added until the end of the year, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes. in combination with the existing asset purchase programme (app), this will support favourable financing conditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty. the governing council continues to expect net asset purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ecb interest rates.

council recalibrated its monetary policy instruments as follows: first, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit

extended the horizon for net purchases under the pepp to at least the end of march 2022. in any case, the governing council will conduct net purchases until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase

roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. third, the governing council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii). specifically, it decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable terms will apply by twelve months, to june 2022. three additional operations will also be conducted between june and december 2021. moreover, the governing council decided to raise the total amount that counterparties will be entitled to borrow in tltro iii operations from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of their stock of eligible loans. in order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated tltro iii borrowing conditions will be made available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance target. fourth, the governing council decided to extend to june 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures adopted by the governing council on 7 and 22 april 2020. the extension of these measures will continue to ensure that banks can make full use of the eurosystem's liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated tltros. the governing council will reassess the collateral easing measures before june 2022, ensuring that eurosystem counterparties’ participation in tltro iii operations is not adversely affected. fifth, the governing council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (peltros) in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop. sixth, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (app) will continue at a monthly pace of 20 billion. the governing council

the eurosystem repo facility for central banks (eurep) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central banks will be extended until march 2022. finally, the governing council decided to continue conducting its regular lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary. separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the governing council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 cet. the monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. at the same time,

june. the calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect its evolving assessment of the outlook. if the incoming data support the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even after the end of its net asset purchases, the governing council will conclude net purchases under the app in the third quarter. if the medium-term inflation outlook changes and if financing conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards the 2% target, the governing council stands ready to revise its schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration. the governing council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. any adjustments to the key ecb interest rates will take place some time after the end of the governing council's net purchases under the app and will be gradual. the path for the key ecb interest rates will continue to be determined by the governing council's forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term. accordingly, the governing council expects the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. in the first quarter of 2022, the governing council is conducting net asset purchases under the pepp at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. it will discontinue net asset purchases under the pepp at the end of march 2022. the governing council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the pepp until at least the end of 2024. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. the pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the governing council's efforts to achieve its goal more effective. within the governing council's mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. in particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, pepp reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. this could include purchasing bonds issued by the hellenic republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. net purchases under the pepp could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic. the governing council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. the governing council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. as announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under tltro iii to end in june this year. the governing council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity. in view of the highly uncertain environment caused by the russian invasion of ukraine and the risk of regional spillovers that could adversely affect euro area financial markets, the governing council decided to extend the eurosystem repo facility for central banks (eurep) until 15 january 2023. eurep will therefore continue to complement the regular euro liquidity-providing arrangements for non-euro area central banks. together, these form a comprehensive set of backstop facilities to address possible euro liquidity needs in the event of market dysfunctions outside the euro area that could adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ecb's monetary policy. requests from non-euro area central banks for individual euro liquidity lines will be assessed by the governing council on a case-by-case basis. the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. the president of the ecb will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 cet today."

uncertainty are weighing heavily on the confidence of businesses and consumers. trade disruptions are leading to new shortages of materials and inputs. surging energy and commodity prices are reducing

economic activity is still being supported by the reopening of the economy after the crisis phase of the pandemic. inflation has increased significantly and will remain high over the coming months,

in may inflation again rose significantly, mainly because of surging energy and food prices, including due to the impact of the war. but inflation pressures have broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly. eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly. these projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time. however, moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation. the new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022, before it is projected to decline to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024 – higher than in the march projections. this means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above the governing council's target. inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3.3% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024 – also above the march projections. russia's unjustified aggression towards ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in europe and beyond. it is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials, and is contributing to high energy and commodity prices. these factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth, especially in the near term. however, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic. once current headwinds abate, economic activity is expected to pick up again. this outlook is broadly reflected in the eurosystem staff projections, which foresee annual real gdp growth at 2.8% in 2022, 2.1% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. compared with the march projections, the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and 2023, while for 2024 it has been revised up. on the basis of its updated assessment, the governing council decided to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy. throughout this process, the governing council will maintain optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. the governing council decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme (app) as of 1 july 2022. the governing council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance. as concerns the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp), the governing council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, pepp reinvestments can be

avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. net purchases under the pepp could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic. the governing council undertook a careful review of the conditions which, according to its forward guidance, should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ecb interest rates. as a result of this assessment, the governing council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied. accordingly, and in line with the governing council's policy sequencing, the governing council intends to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points at its july monetary policy meeting. in the meantime, the governing council decided to leave the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. looking further ahead, the governing council expects to raise the key ecb interest rates again in september. the calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. if the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at the september meeting. beyond september, based on its current assessment, the governing council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. in line with the governing council's commitment to its 2% medium-term target, the pace at which the governing council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation to develop in the medium term. the governing council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. the governing council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. as announced previously, the special conditions applicable under tltro iii will end on 23 june 2022. the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. the pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of

governing council took further key steps to make sure inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term. the governing council decided to raise the three key ecb interest rates by 50 basis points and approved the transmission protection instrument (tpi). the governing council judged that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting. this decision is based on the governing council's updated assessment of inflation risks and the reinforced support provided by the tpi for the effective transmission of monetary policy. it will support the return of inflation to the governing council's medium-term target by strengthening the anchoring of inflation expectations and by ensuring that demand conditions adjust to deliver its inflation target in the medium term. at the governing council's upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. the frontloading today of the exit from negative interest rates allows the governing council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions. the governing council's future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help to deliver on its 2% inflation target over the medium term. in the context of its policy normalisation, the governing council will evaluate options for remunerating excess liquidity holdings. the governing council assessed that the establishment of the tpi is necessary to support the effective transmission of monetary policy. in particular, as the governing council continues normalising monetary policy, the tpi will ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. the singleness of the governing council's monetary policy is a precondition for the ecb to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. the tpi will be an addition to the governing council's toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. the scale of tpi purchases depends on the severity of the risks facing policy transmission. by safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the tpi will allow the governing council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. in any event, the flexibility in reinvestments of redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) portfolio remains the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. the details of the tpi are described in a separate press release to be published at 15:45 cet. the governing council decided to raise the three key ecb interest rates by 50 basis points. accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 0.50%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively, with effect from 27 july 2022. at the governing council's upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. the frontloading today of the exit from negative interest rates allows the governing council to make a transition to a meeting-by-meeting approach to interest rate decisions. the governing council's future policy rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help to deliver on its 2% inflation target over the medium term. the governing council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance. as concerns the pepp, the governing council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. in any case, the future roll-off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. redemptions coming due in the pepp portfolio are being reinvested flexibly, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. the governing council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (tltro iii) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy.
